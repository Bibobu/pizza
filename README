# Important notes

This repository is a fork of the original pizza.py software package distributed
by Sandia National Laboratories and maintained (as far as I know) by S.Plimpton
as explained below.

The pizza.py tools were written 15 years ago in python2. With the drop of
python 2 support, this makes the tools obsolete. As it is a shame that such
work would be lost and that some of them are still of good use, I've converted
the files to python3. As the Python ecosystem hugely developped in the last
20 years, a number of tools are still obsolete like some of the plotting and
visualization scripts in the repository. The end of support of some of the
library from python 2 to python 3 (like togl) makes it hard to convert them.
Due to lack of test case, I am also unsure of some of the ports that might be
buggy.

Still, I think these can be packaged and used in independent application. As
LAMMPS still does not have any dedicated set of tools apart from those, I
intend to use them as a basis. I know that some tools are "read/write it all"
and can convert stuff from any MD software to another but that is something I
am reluctent to consider before each software has a set of dedicated tools.

This project is not endorsed or commited to the LAMMPS/Pizza repository
maintained by SNL and Temple university. Use these files at your own risks.

## Project goals

* Any feedback is welcomed in order to look out for bugs and stuff.
* Propose a packageable version of pizza, if accepted it would be cool
  - The way the tools was written was clever but bad practice
    (adding functions to interactive python by catching error process and
    parsing/executing commands).
  - It would be beneficial to have a proper package:
    ```
    import pizza as pz
    from pizza import data
    ...
    ```
* As mentioned, many feature such as graphic interface use etc are hard to port
  However, using a pizza package to treat data in another program dedicated
  to plotting could make use of new opengl features developed over the years
  easier. More on that in yet another project.

Pizza.py is a loosely integrated collection of tools written in
Python, many of which provide pre- and post-processing capability for
the LAMMPS molecular dynamics package.  There are tools to create
input files, convert between file formats, process log and dump files,
create plots, and visualize and animate simulation snapshots.

Pizza.py was developed at Sandia National Laboratories, a US
Department of Energy facility, with funding from the DOE.  It is an
open-source code, distributed freely under the terms of the GNU Public

The maintainer of Pizza.py is Steve Plimpton, who can be emailed at

the code and its uses.
