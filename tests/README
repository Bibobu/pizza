# Test directory

This directory contains updated version of the former examples scripts
present in the original example directory. The files have been modified to
be at least usable with the necessary libraries. Since some files in the
./files directory were not present in the original repository, some of the
test could not be reproduced. These tests are noted with xxx in the name.
For example: test_bdump_xxx.py

*IMPORTANT NOTE:* Contrary to what is explained below, the new tests are
made to be run like traditional python scripts:

```
   python test_scipt.py
```

# From former example directory

This directory contains a collection of example scripts.  There is one
test_*.py script for each tool in Pizza.py.  These illustrate how to
use the tool.  The small data sets used by these scripts are in the
files sub-directly.

A test_*.py script can be run by launching Pizza.py from this
directory, e.g.

% pizza.py -f test_animate.py           from the shell
> @run test_animtate.py                 from Pizza.py

The other scripts in this directory perform specific tasks.  Read the
comments at the top of the script file for an explanation.  Most of
these scripts require a data set to operate on, which is not provided.
These scripts are included simply to illustrate how a particular task
can be done in Pizza.py.

These scripts create output and temporary files as they operate.
These are all named tmp*.  Pizza.py does not clean up all the
temporary files, since they are sometimes useful to look at for
debugging or other purposes.
