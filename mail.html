<H4>Ways to use the Pizza.py mail list 
</H4>
<P>Anyone can post messages to the list or browse/search previous
questions/answers in the archives.  You can view the <A HREF = "http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=pizza-py-users">archives at
SourceForge</A>.
If you want to subscribe and answer questions yourself, that would be
great!
</P>
<UL><LI>Anyone can post a message or question to the list by sending email to
pizza-py-users at lists.sourceforge.net.  Don't include big files.  If
you are a subscriber, your message will appear immediately.  If you
are not a subscriber, your message will be moderated, which typically
takes a day before your message appears on the list.  When someone
replies you will receive that reply as a personal email, and the reply
will appear on the list in the new thread your message started.
Posting a message sends email to subscribers immediately, but it can
take a few hours for postings and replies to show up in the
SourceForge archive. 

<LI>To subscribe to the mail list, visit <A HREF = "http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=149496">this
page</A>.  If you subscribe
to the list you receive emails when people post to the list and can
reply with a response.  After you subscribe, you will be sent a
confirmation email.  When you reply, your subscription is enabled.
You can changes settings for your subscription or unsubscribe from the
<A HREF = "http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=149496">same page</A>.  By default
you get an email each time someone posts to the list; you can receive
a daily digest instead.  When you receive an email, you can reply only
to the sender of the posting, or you can also CC your response to
lammps-users at lists.sourceforge.net (e.g. reply-all) and your
response will be archived on the list in the same thread. 

<LI>There is no way to reply to a posting (via the mail list) unless you
are a subscriber.
