What version of Pizza.py do you have? :h4,link(version)

A Pizza.py "version" is the date when it was released, such as 1 Sept
2010.  Pizza.py is updated continuously.  Every time we fix a bug or
add a feature, we release it immediately, as listed below.  Each dated
copy of Pizza.py contains all the features and bug-fixes up to and
including that version date.  The version date is printed to the
screen every time you run Pizza.py.  It is also in the file
src/pizza.py and in the Pizza.py directory name created when you
unpack a tarball.

If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages on the Pizza.py WWW site, they
always describe the most current version of Pizza.py. :ulb,l

If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages included in your tarball, they

Maintentance patch.  A few small feature updates and bug fixes.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.9Oct15 from the 2
Jul 2014 version.

:line

[2 Jul 2014]

Changed the name of the clog tool to "olog"_doc/olog.html to stand for
reading of other log files.  This is because the log files can now
come from a variety of other programs: ChemCell, SPPARKS, SPARTA.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.2Jul14 from the 30
Jun 2014 version.

:line

[30 Jun 2014]

New "sdata"_doc/sdata.html tool for reading, creating, and writing out
surface files used as input to the "SPARTA"_http://sparta.sandia.gov
Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) code.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.30Jun14 from the 7
Feb 2013 version.

:line

[7 Feb 2014]

Added some logic to the "dump"_doc/dump.html tool to deal more
correctly with empty snapshots that have no atoms.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.7Feb14 from the 11
Sep 2013 version.

:line

[11 Sep 2013]

One additional change to the "data"_doc/data.html tool, to
support the changes to the "patch"_doc/patch.html tool.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.11Sep13 from the 10
Sep 2013 version.

:line

[10 Sep 2013]

Added some options to the "patch"_doc/patch.html tool, for
different kinds of patchy and rigid-body particles.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.10Sep13 from the 6
Aug 2012 version.

:line

[6 Aug 2012]

Made the "dump"_doc/dump.html tool backward compatible with the dump
file format produced by other codes besides LAMMPS, specifically with
respect to the BOX BOUNDS info in the dump file.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.5Aug12 from the 14
Jun 2012 version.

:line

[14 Jun 2012]

Added more support to the "dump"_doc/dump.html tool for triclinic
(non-orthogonal) boxes.  Removed the size() method from the
"gl"_doc/gl.html tool, and made it part of the constructor, so that
the window size can be selected one time at launch.  Dynamic resizing
does not seem to work in some windowing systems.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.14Jun12 from the 22
May 2012 version.

:line

[22 May 2012]

Forgot to include some data files used by the example scripts
in yesterday's patch.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.22May12 from the 21
May 2012 version.

:line

[21 May 2012]

Made some updates to the test scripts in the examples dir,
to make them compatible with the current version of Pizza.py.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.21May12 from the 9
Feb 2012 version.

:line

[9 Feb 2012]

Made the "dump"_doc/dump.html tool scale and unscale atom coordinates
correctly for triclinic geometries, which is indicated by extra BOX
BOUNDS fields in the dump file.

Also made some minor changes for how mesh dump files and the
"mdump"_doc/mdump.html tool are treated by the "dump"_doc/dump.html
tool.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.9Feb12 from the 8
Dec 2011 version.

:line

[8 Dec 2011]

Upgraded the write commmand for the "dump"_doc/dump.html tool
to write out ints for the "id" and "type" columns of dump
data, but floats for everything else.  Previously it assumed
the 1st 2 columns were int and the rest float, but custom
dump files are often not formatted that way.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.8Dec11 from the 7
Oct 2011 version.

:line

[7 Oct 2011]

Added a glutInit() call to the "gl"_doc/gl.html tool since some
versions of freeglut seem to require this.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.7Oct11 from the 15
Sep 2011 version.

:line

[15 Sep 2011]

Added the "tdump"_doc/tdump.html tool which can work with the
"dump"_doc/dump.html tool to visualze triangles from a LAMMPS
simulation.  Also added some options to the "patch"_doc/patch.html
tool to enable creation of rigid bodies built out of triangles.

Also made the auto-unscaling feature of the "dump"_doc/dump.html tool
be up-to-date with the current self-documenting format of LAMMPS dump
files.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.15Sep11 from the 27
May 2011 version.

:line

[27 May 2011]

Updated the PDF manual.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.27May11 from the 19
May 2011 version.

:line

[19 May 2011]

David Hart (Sandia) added some start-up logic to insure the
GL tool does not cause problems when running without a display.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.19May11 from the 18
May 2011 version.

:line

[18 May 2011]

Changed to continuous updating of versions, rather than increments
to an occasionally released version.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.18May11 from the 24
Nov 2010 version.

:line

[24 Nov 2010]

Axel Kohlmeyer (Temple U) added a "vmd"_doc/vmd.html tool that is a
wrapper on the popular "VMD visualization package"_vmd, which allows
it to be controlled from Python and Pizza.py scripts.  In particular
it allows the interactive visualization of molecular dynamics
snapshots as generated from "LAMMPS"_http://lammps.sandia.gov.  See
the python directory in the LAMMPS distribution for examples of
scripts that do this.

:link(vmd,http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd)

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.24Nov10 from the 23
Nov 2010 version.

:line

[23 Nov 2010]

Added the "ldump"_doc/ldump.html and "bdump"_doc/bdump.html tools
which can work with the "dump"_doc/dump.html tool to visualze line
segments and bonds from a LAMMPS simulation.  Also added some options
to the "patch"_doc/patch.html tool to enable creation of 2d rigid
bodies built out of line segments.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.23Nov10 from the 1
Oct 2010 version.

:line

[1 Oct 2010]

Jeff Greathouse (Sandia) added a density_area.py script to the scripts
dir, which allows integrating the area under the density profile.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.1Oct10 from the 19
Apr 2010 version.

:line

[19 Apr 2010]

Added setv() method to "dump"_doc/dump.html tool, and new options on
write() method.  This is to allow easier manipulation of a set of dump
files for nudged elastic band (NEB) calculation in LAMMPS, to produce
snapshots that contain atoms from multiple replicas.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.19Apr10 from the 8
Dec 2009 version.

:line

[8 Dec 2009]

David Hart (Sandia) added a density2d.py script.  He also added an
error check for running without a display, so that Tkinter will do the
right thing and not try to create GUI windows for certain tools.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.8Dec09 from the 7
Dec 2009 version.

:line

[7 Dec 2009]

David Hart (Sandia) enhanced the "dump"_doc/dump.html and
"mdump"_doc/mdump.html tools to allow use of the NumPy Python package.
This means Pizza.py can now use either NumPy or the older Numeric
pacakge.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.7Dec09 from the 22
Nov 2009 version.

:line

[22 Nov 2009]

Enhanced the "dump"_doc/dump.html tool write and scatter commands to
write self-describing LAMMPS dump files, with atom column info.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.22Nov09 from the 21
Nov 2009 version.

:line

[21 Nov 2009]

Changed some file opens to include a binary-mode flag, so that
they will open and can be seeked correctly under Windows.  Never
saw this issue on Linux or a Mac.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.21Nov09 from the 3
Jun 2009 version.

Thanks to Ting Li (KULeuven) for flagging this issue.

:line

[3 Jun 2009]

Another upgrade to the "dump"_doc/dump.html tool to allow it to read
self-describing LAMMPS (or other) dump files that have the names of
the per-atom columns embedded in the file.  This one insures
that all versions of coordinates (x,xs,xu) are recognized by
the dump tool, so you don't have to use the dump.map() method.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.3Jun09 from the 16
Mar 2009 version.

Thanks to Carolyn Phillips (U Mich) for pointing this out.

:line

[16 Mar 2009]

Upgraded the "dump"_doc/dump.html tool to allow it to read
self-describing LAMMPS (or other) dump files that have the names of
the per-atom columns embedded in the file.  If reading this
format of file, it means you don't have to label the columns
yourself with the dump.map() method.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.16Mar09 from the 1
Dec 2008 version.

:line

[1 Dec 2008]

Added a reorder command to the "data"_doc/data.html tool to allow data
files for different LAMMPS atom styles to more easily be created.

Also added some options to the "patch"_doc/patch.html tool to allow it
to create 2d systems, and 2d stars and boxes and dimers as output
composite particles.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.1Dec08 from the 17
Nov 2007 version.

:line

[17 Nov 2007]

Fixed a one-line glitch in the 15Nov07 patch.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.17Nov07 from the 15
Nov 2007 version.

:line

[15 Nov 2007]

Added support to the "data"_doc/data.html tool for non-orthogonal
triclinic boxes in LAMMPS via the "xy xz yz" keyword that can appear
in the header portion of the data file.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.15Nov07 from the 10
Aug 2007 version.

Thanks to Krishna Iyengar (Cornell U) for identifying the problem.

:line

[10 Aug 2007]

Added some sync logic to the "gl"_doc/gl.html and "vcr"_doc/vcr.html
tools to insure GL screenshots are captured correctly to files.  Was
having trouble with this on a faster graphics box.

Also updated the Pizza.py install directions substantially,
to give details of how to install all the various Python
packages used by all the Pizza.py tools on a Linux box.

In particular, the latest 3.0 version of PyOpenGL and the Tkinter
graphics lib seem much easier to install, so if that was a problem for
you before, try out the new instructions.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.10Aug07 from the 17
Jun 2007 version.

:line

[17 June 2007]

Fixed some one-line bugs with opening gzipped files by various
tools.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.17Jun07 from the 3
May 2007 version.

Thanks to Vladimir Stegailov for identifying the problem.

:line

[3 May 2007]

Added class 2 fields to the "data"_doc/data.html tool so it
can deal with LAMMPS data files that contain class 2 potential info.

Also added an option to the "plotview"_doc/plotview.html tool
to set which vector is treated as the x-axis.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.3May07 from the 14
Apr 2007 version.

Thanks to James Palko for pointing out the data tool deficiency.

:line

[14 Apr 2007]

Added a "mdump"_doc/mdump.html tool to read in mesh files and allow
them to be converted to Ensight format or visualized directly with
other Pizza.py tools such as the "gl"_doc/gl.html and
"raster"_doc/raster.html tools.

The mesh file format is described on the "mdump"_doc/mdump.html doc
page.  2d triangular and 3d tetrahedral meshes are currently
supported.  Meshes can be static or dynamic and have nodal and/or
element quantities defined.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.14Apr07 from the 13
Apr 2007 version.

:line

[13 Apr 2007]

Added a sort option to the "dump"_doc/dump.html tool to allow
sorting of atom snapshots by any column (e.g. x or type) rather
than the default which is by atom ID.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.13Apr07 from the 12
Apr 2007 version.

:line

[12 Apr 2007]

Aidan Thompson (Sandia) has written a new file conversion tool, called
"cfg"_doc/cfg.html, which converts LAMMPS snapshots to the CFG format
used by the "AtomEye"_http://164.107.79.177/Archive/Graphics/A
visualization package.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.12Apr07 from the 16
Mar 2007 version.

:line

[16 Mar 2007]

Upgraded the "ensight"_doc/ensight.html tool to allow for empty
snapshots and consistency of the number of particle types across
snapshots, which Ensight seems to like.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.16Mar07 from the 31
Jan 2007 version.

:line

[31 Jan 2007]

Fixed a couple bugs in the new "ensight"_doc/ensight.html tool, as
well as made some other minor tweaks to various files.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.31Jan07 from the 3
Nov 2006 version.

:line

[3 Nov 2006]

Added a capability for the "vec"_doc/vec.html tool to accept a list of
numeric vectors as input.  They can then be plotted interactively via
the "plotview"_doc/plotview.html tool.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.3Nov06 from the 10
Oct 2006 version.

:line

[10 Oct 2006]

Added an "ensight"_doc/ensight.html tool that can convert LAMMPS or
ChemCell data/dump files to the file format used as input to the
"Ensight visualization package"_ensight.  Ensight is a widely-used
commercial package with a GUI front-end that can perform high-quality
viz and animation.

:link(ensight,http://www.ensight.com)

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.10Oct06 from the 1
