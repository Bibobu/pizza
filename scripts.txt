Pizza.py Scripts :h3

The Pizza.py distribution includes a collection of scripts written by
Pizza.py users.  Those in the scripts directory are generically
useful; you may wish to use them directly or modify them for your own
purposes.  Those in the examples directory either illustrate how to
use a particular tool or were written to perform a specfic task.

Here is the list of scripts from the scripts directory.  Clicking on
the script name will display the text of the script.

"angle_distribute.py"_scripts/angle_distribute.py: distribution of angles from LAMMPS dump file
"block.py"_scripts/block.py: thermodynamic block averages from LAMMPS log files
"bond_distribute.py"_scripts/bond_distribute.py: distribution of bonds from LAMMPS dump file
"clogview.py"_scripts/clogview.py: plots of ChemCell log-file time courses
"cluster.py"_scripts/cluster.py: histogram of cluster size of type2 atoms near type1
"density.py"_scripts/density.py: binned atom density by atom type
"distance.py"_scripts/distance.py: check on atom pair distances
"dview.py"_scripts/dview.py: launch vcr tool on LAMMPS dump files
"flux.py"_scripts/flux.py: flux of atoms through a user-defined plane
"iview.py"_scripts/iview.py: launch animate tool on series of image files
"logview.py"_scripts/logview.py: plots of LAMMPS log-file thermodynamic data
"movie.py"_scripts/movie.py: create images from LAMMPS dump snapshots
"plot.py"_scripts/plot.py: create series of plots from a file of vector data  :tb(s=:)

Running any of these scripts is as simple as typing a line appropriate
to the script's syntax, e.g.

% pizza.py -f movie.py svg 60 135 dump.*       from the shell
> @run movie.py svg 60 135 dump.*              from Pizza.py :pre

The top of each script file describes its purpose and syntax.  That
information can be be accessed from within Pizza.py by typing "??" or
"? name.py" or "?? name.py".
