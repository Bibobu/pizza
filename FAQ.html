<A NAME = "1_1"></A><I><B>1.1 What is Pizza.py?</B></I> 

<P>Pizza.py is a loosely integrated collection of tools written in
Python, many of which provide pre- and post-processing capability for
the <A HREF = "../lammps.html">LAMMPS</A> molecular dynamics package.  There are
tools to create input files, convert between file formats, process log
and dump files, create plots, and visualize and animate simulation
snapshots.  Eventually it will include tools for other simulations as
well.
</P>
<P>More generally, Pizza.py is two things.  The top-level of Pizza.py
extends the Python interpreter in a few simple ways to make it easier
to invoke shell commands, launch scripts, and query help on tools.
Secondly, the Pizza.py tools are Python modules designed with
interfaces that allow them to interact with and/or replace each other
in simple, yet powerful ways.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "1_2"></A><I><B>1.2 How can I use Pizza.py?</B></I> 

<P>Pizza.py can be used in several different ways:
</P>
<UL><LI>via interactive typing, to examine simulation data sets
<LI>via scripts to perform analysis with Pizza.py tools
<LI>via scripts to automate repetitive tasks
<LI>via tool GUIs to interact with simulation data 
</UL>
<P>Other than a few basic syntax rules, you do not need to know any
Python to use Pizza.py tools.  However, if you are familiar with
Python, you will be able to use the tools in more sophisticated ways,
write your own scripts for analysis purposes, add methods to existing
tools, or even create new tools of your own.
</P>
<P>A Pizza.py tool (just a *.py file) can be used directly in Python,
without the rest of Pizza.py.  Pizza.py scripts can be run by others,
who don't have Pizza.py, to run in their Python (so long as you also
give them any tool files the script uses).
</P>
<P>New tools you write need not have anything to do with LAMMPS.  They
could be a stand-alone tool or interact with existing Pizza.py tools
in various ways.  For example, you could write a new tool that
</P>
<UL><LI>reads your files and creates plots via Pizza.py plotting tools
<LI>reads your simulation output and creates images via Pizza.py viz tools
<LI>creates an atomisitc geometry and creates a LAMMPS data file via the data tool 
</UL>
<HR>

<A NAME = "1_3"></A><I><B>1.3 What is the philosophy behind Pizza.py?</B></I> 

<P>In the pizza metaphor ...
</P>
<UL><LI>toppings = tools
<LI>crust = Pizza.py extensions to the Python interpreter
<LI>cheese = Python 
</UL>
<P>A "tool", as implemented in Pizza.py, has the following
characteristics:
</P>
<UL><LI>can be controlled by typing or script or GUI (if it has one)
<LI>does not take over the desktop
<LI>has an interface identical to other functionally similar tools 
</UL>
<P>The 1st point means that GUI operations can also be done at the
commmand line, so any tool's capabilities can be scripted.  The 2nd
point means that if a tool opens a GUI window, it does not lock the
mouse to it; multiple instances of the same tool or of other tools can
be operational at the same time.  The 3rd point means that groups of
tools share identical (or at least similar) methods so they be used
interchangeably.  Examples of this are:

<A NAME = "1_4"></A><I><B>1.4 Why Python?</B></I> 

<P>Sometimes a toolkit like Pizza.py is called a framework.  My view is
that Python itself is the ideal framework for glueing together various
tools and third-party applications.  Aside from its snake-like ability
to wrap other software, Python is a powerful object-oriented
programming language in its own right.
</P>
<P>I've dabbled in other scripting languages (Perl, Tcl/Tk, shell) but
Python is my favorite.  For non-parallel, non-CPU-intensive
programming, it's my language of choice, for these reasons:
</P>
<UL><LI>clean, simple pseudo-code syntax
<LI>supports object-oriented or functional programming
<LI>extensive built-in and external libraries
<LI>less code to write (often 2-3x less lines than C++)
<LI>portability (all machines run Python) 
</UL>
<HR>

<HR>

<A NAME = "2_1"></A><I><B>2.1 What can I do with LAMMPS log files (thermodynamic data)?</B></I> 

<P>With the <A HREF = "doc/log.html">log tool</A> you can:
</P>
<UL><LI>read in one or more LAMMPS log files, including incomplete ones
<LI>extract their data as vectors
<LI>write the vectors to files
<LI>plot the vectors (via gnu, matlab, plotview tools) 
</UL>
<P>For example, making a plot of a thermodynamic quantity vs time from
a series of log files is as simple as:
</P>
<PRE>lg = log("log.*")
s,t = lg.get("Step","Temp")
m = matlab()
m.plot(s,t) 
</PRE>
<HR>

<A NAME = "2_2"></A><I><B>2.2 What can I do with LAMMPS dump files (atom snapshots)?</B></I> 

<P>With the <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump tool</A> you can:
</P>
<UL><LI>read in one or more LAMMPS dump files, including incomplete ones
<LI>wrap/unwrap atom coords across periodic boundaries
<LI>sub-select certain atoms or timesteps
<LI>extract atom attributes as vectors within or across snapshots
<LI>compute and store new atom attributes
<LI>plot vectors (via gnu, matlab)
<LI>visualize one or more snapshots (via raster, rasmol, svg)
<LI>display and animate them in a VCR-style GUI viewer (via gl, vcr)
<LI>convert to other file formats (via ensight, pdb, vtk, xyz) 
</UL>
<P>For example, converting a set of dump file snapshots to XYZ format is
as simple as:
</P>
<PRE>d = dump("dump.*")
x = xyz(d)
x.many() 
</PRE>
<P>which could also be written as one line:
</P>
<PRE>xyz(dump("dump.*")).many() 
</PRE>
<HR>

<A NAME = "2_3"></A><I><B>2.3 What can I do with OpenGL from within Pizza.py?</B></I> 

<P>The <A HREF = "doc/gl.html">gl tool</A> in Pizza.py is a wrapper on OpenGL graphics
via the <A HREF = "http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net">PyOpenGL</A> package.  The <A HREF = "doc/vcr.html">vcr
tool</A> puts a GUI wrapper around one or more OpenGL
windows.  With these tools you can:
</P>
<UL><LI>open an interactive window displaying a LAMMPS data file or snapshot
<LI>use the mouse to translate,rotate,zoom the displayed image
<LI>use the VCR-style buttons and sliders to animate/save a sequence of images
<LI>use the clipping sliders to narrow the range of atoms displayed
<LI>animate a fly-by or zoom-in of one or more snapshots
<LI>choose color/radii attributes of atom and bond types 
</UL>
<HR>

<A NAME = "2_4"></A><I><B>2.4 What can I do with RasMol from within Pizza.py?</B></I> 

<P>The <A HREF = "doc/rasmol.html">rasmol tool</A> in Pizza.py is a wrapper on the
popular <A HREF = "http://openrasmol.org">RasMol</A> molecular visualization program.  With the
rasmol and <A HREF = "doc/pdb.html">pdb</A> tools you can:
</P>
<UL><LI>drive RasMol interactively or via its command-line
<LI>convert LAMMPS snapshots into PDB files
<LI>visualize one or more LAMMPS snapshots
<LI>create an animation (multiple images) of a set of PDB files or snapshots
<LI>download a PDB file from the WWW and view it 
</UL>
<P>For example, to make an MPEG movie from RasMol images of LAMMPS
snapshots using "peptide.pdb" as a template PDB file, you could type:
</P>
<PRE>d = dump("dump.*")
p = pdb("peptide",d)
r = rasmol(p)
r.all()
!convert image*gif protein.mpg 
</PRE>
<P>The last line is not part of Pizza.py; it simply invokes the
ImageMagick "convert" program to turn a series of GIF files into an
MPEG movie.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "2_5"></A><I><B>2.5 What can I do with Raster3d from within Pizza.py?</B></I> 

<P>The <A HREF = "doc/raster.html">raster tool</A> in Pizza.py is a wrapper on the
<A HREF = "http://www.bmsc.washington.edu/raster3d/raster3d.html">Raster3d</A> molecular visualization program which creates
ray-traced images of a molecular model.  With the raster tool you can:
</P>
<UL><LI>run Raster3d and control its settings from Python
<LI>create and view single or multiple images of LAMMPS snapshots
<LI>animate a fly-by or zoom-in of one or more snapshots
<LI>choose color/radii attributes of atom and bond types
<LI>put text labels on snapshot images 
</UL>
<P>For example, to create an image sequence of LAMMPS snapshots from a
chosen viewpoint, and view them in the <A HREF = "doc/animate.html">animate
tool</A>, you could type:
</P>
<PRE>d = dump("dump.*")
r = raster(d)
r.rotate(45,120)
r.all()
animate("image*.png") 
</PRE>
<HR>

<A NAME = "2_6"></A><I><B>2.6 What can I do with SVG (scalable vector graphics) via
Pizza.py?</B></I> 

<P><A HREF = "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG">SVG</A> is a portable file format that can be used to visualize
many, many things, including atoms and bonds.  It's particularly nice
for solid-state systems with atoms on lattices.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "doc/svg.html">svg tool</A> in Pizza.py creates SVG files from LAMMPS
snapshots.  The tool's interface is the same as for the raster tool
discussed in the previous FAQ question.  Thus you can create SVG
images in place of Raster3d images by changing one line in the example
above, i.e. "r = svg(d)".
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "2_7"></A><I><B>2.7 What can I do with GnuPlot from within Pizza.py?</B></I> 

<P><A HREF = "http://www.gnuplot.info">GnuPlot</A> is an open-source plotting package from the GNU
folks.  The "gnuplot tool" in Pizza.py lets you:
</P>
<UL><LI>pass vectors of Python or LAMMPS data to GnuPlot (via files)
<LI>plot one or more vectors in one or more windows
<LI>set basic plot attributes (range, labels, colors, symbols)
<LI>issue native GnuPlot commands either one-at-a-time or in a GnuPlot shell
<LI>create an animation of a plot (multiple plots of growing vectors)
<LI>save your plots as PostScript files 
</UL>
<P>Only a small subset of GnuPlot commands are wrapped as gnu tool
methods by Pizza.py, but any GnuPlot operation can be performed from
within Pizza.py by issuing using native GnuPlot commands.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "2_8"></A><I><B>2.8 What can I do with MatLab from within Pizza.py?</B></I> 

<P><A HREF = "http://www.mathworks.com">MatLab</A> is a commercial numerical analysis program that does
many, many things, one of which is make nice plots.  The Pizza.py
<A HREF = "doc/matlab.html">matlab tool</A> wraps the plotting functionality in
MatLab with the same interface as it does GnuPlot.  So you can do
exactly the same things with MatLab plots as listed in the previoue
FAQ question for GnuPlot, i.e. creating MatLab plots instead of
GnuPlot plots is as simple as changing one line in your script.
</P>
<P>As with GnuPlot, you can drive MatLab interactively either
one-command-at-a-time or via the MatLab shell (as if you were typing
at the MatLab prompt).  This means your Python and LAMMPS data can be
exported to MatLab (as a file), and you can then operate on it with
any MatLab commands or functions you wish.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "2_9"></A><I><B>2.9 What can I do with image files from within Pizza.py?</B></I> 

<P>The <A HREF = "doc/image.html">image tool</A> in Pizza.py displays thumbnails for a
set of image files, that can be clicked on to display the full file.
The tool is also a wrapper on the <A HREF = "http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</A> "convert"
and "montage" commands, so that
</P>
<UL><LI>a series of images can be converted to an MPG movie
<LI>one series of images can be converted to another series in another format
<LI>two or more series of images can be combined into a new series of montage images 
</UL>
