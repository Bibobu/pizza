<H3>Pizza.py Movies 
</H3>
<P>These are various animations created with Pizza.py for output data
from the <A HREF = "../lammps.html">LAMMPS</A> molecular dynamics simulator.  Some
are from 3d simulations; others are from simpler 2d systems that
illustrate the kinds of problems LAMMPS can easily be setup to run.
</P>


<P>For each problem, Pizza.py was used to create a series of images.  I
use the ImageMagick convert program to make lo-resolution MPEG movies
and QuickTime Pro (on a Mac laptop) to make hi-resolution QuickTime
movies.  The lo-res MPEG movies are posted here; a single hi-res image
frame is also shown so you can see what the QuickTime movie looks
like.  Links to the Pizza.py scripts that created the image sequences
are also given.
</P>
<P>For all movies on this page, click on the small image to trigger the
animation.  You may need to slow-down/speed-up the MPEG playback on
your machine.  If your browser uses the "xanim" program to view MPEG
movies, the speed-up key is "-" and the slow-down key is "=".

<H4><A NAME = "bucky"></A>Decorated bucky-ball particle self-assembly 
</H4>
<P>Each particle is a rigid C60 molecule with two patches of attractive
atoms on each end that induce ordering with nearby particles.  These
images were made with the Pizza.py raster tool wrapping Raster3d.

behavior.

plots was made using the mplot() method of the <A HREF = "doc/gnu.html">gnu tool</A>

<H4><A NAME = "grain"></A>2d grain growth via Potts model 
</H4>
<P>Each pixel is a lattice site in a 2d Potts model formulated to model
grain growth via Monte Carlo sweeps of the lattice.  These images were
made with the Pizza.py raster tool wrapping Raster3d reading a mesh
file with the <A HREF = "doc/mdump.html">mdump</A> tool.  Thanks to Aidan Thompson
for implementation of the Potts model in a kinetic Monte Carlo code we
are developing at Sandia.
