</P>
<HR>

<P><B>2 Jul 2014</B>
</P>
<P>Changed the name of the clog tool to <A HREF = "doc/olog.html">olog</A> to stand for
reading of other log files.  This is because the log files can now
come from a variety of other programs: ChemCell, SPPARKS, SPARTA.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.2Jul14">list of changed files</A> from the 30
Jun 2014 version.

<P><B>30 Jun 2014</B>
</P>
<P>New <A HREF = "doc/sdata.html">sdata</A> tool for reading, creating, and writing out
surface files used as input to the <A HREF = "http://sparta.sandia.gov">SPARTA</A>
Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) code.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.30Jun14">list of changed files</A> from the 7
Feb 2013 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>7 Feb 2014</B>
</P>
<P>Added some logic to the <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump</A> tool to deal more
correctly with empty snapshots that have no atoms.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.7Feb14">list of changed files</A> from the 11
Sep 2013 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>11 Sep 2013</B>
</P>
<P>One additional change to the <A HREF = "doc/data.html">data</A> tool, to
support the changes to the <A HREF = "doc/patch.html">patch</A> tool.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.11Sep13">list of changed files</A> from the 10
Sep 2013 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>10 Sep 2013</B>
</P>

<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.5Aug12">list of changed files</A> from the 14
Jun 2012 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>14 Jun 2012</B>
</P>
<P>Added more support to the <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump</A> tool for triclinic
(non-orthogonal) boxes.  Removed the size() method from the
<A HREF = "doc/gl.html">gl</A> tool, and made it part of the constructor, so that
the window size can be selected one time at launch.  Dynamic resizing
does not seem to work in some windowing systems.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.14Jun12">list of changed files</A> from the 22
May 2012 version.
</P>

correctly for triclinic geometries, which is indicated by extra BOX
BOUNDS fields in the dump file.
</P>
<P>Also made some minor changes for how mesh dump files and the
<A HREF = "doc/mdump.html">mdump</A> tool are treated by the <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump</A>
tool.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.9Feb12">list of changed files</A> from the 8
Dec 2011 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>8 Dec 2011</B>
</P>
<P>Upgraded the write commmand for the <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump</A> tool
to write out ints for the "id" and "type" columns of dump
data, but floats for everything else.  Previously it assumed
the 1st 2 columns were int and the rest float, but custom
dump files are often not formatted that way.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.8Dec11">list of changed files</A> from the 7
Oct 2011 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>7 Oct 2011</B>
</P>
<P>Added a glutInit() call to the <A HREF = "doc/gl.html">gl</A> tool since some
versions of freeglut seem to require this.

Sep 2011 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>15 Sep 2011</B>
</P>
<P>Added the <A HREF = "doc/tdump.html">tdump</A> tool which can work with the
<A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump</A> tool to visualze triangles from a LAMMPS
simulation.  Also added some options to the <A HREF = "doc/patch.html">patch</A>
tool to enable creation of rigid bodies built out of triangles.
</P>
<P>Also made the auto-unscaling feature of the <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump</A> tool
be up-to-date with the current self-documenting format of LAMMPS dump
files.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.15Sep11">list of changed files</A> from the 27
May 2011 version.
</P>
<HR>

</P>
<HR>

<P><B>24 Nov 2010</B>
</P>
<P>Axel Kohlmeyer (Temple U) added a <A HREF = "doc/vmd.html">vmd</A> tool that is a
wrapper on the popular <A HREF = "http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd">VMD visualization package</A>, which allows
it to be controlled from Python and Pizza.py scripts.  In particular
it allows the interactive visualization of molecular dynamics
snapshots as generated from <A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS</A>.  See
the python directory in the LAMMPS distribution for examples of
scripts that do this.
</P>


<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.24Nov10">list of changed files</A> from the 23

Apr 2010 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>19 Apr 2010</B>
</P>
<P>Added setv() method to <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump</A> tool, and new options on
write() method.  This is to allow easier manipulation of a set of dump
files for nudged elastic band (NEB) calculation in LAMMPS, to produce
snapshots that contain atoms from multiple replicas.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.19Apr10">list of changed files</A> from the 8
Dec 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>8 Dec 2009</B>
</P>
<P>David Hart (Sandia) added a density2d.py script.  He also added an
error check for running without a display, so that Tkinter will do the
right thing and not try to create GUI windows for certain tools.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.8Dec09">list of changed files</A> from the 7
Dec 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>7 Dec 2009</B>
</P>
<P>David Hart (Sandia) enhanced the <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump</A> and
<A HREF = "doc/mdump.html">mdump</A> tools to allow use of the NumPy Python package.
This means Pizza.py can now use either NumPy or the older Numeric
pacakge.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.7Dec09">list of changed files</A> from the 22
Nov 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>22 Nov 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Enhanced the <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump</A> tool write and scatter commands to
write self-describing LAMMPS dump files, with atom column info.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.22Nov09">list of changed files</A> from the 21
Nov 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>21 Nov 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Changed some file opens to include a binary-mode flag, so that
they will open and can be seeked correctly under Windows.  Never
saw this issue on Linux or a Mac.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.21Nov09">list of changed files</A> from the 3
Jun 2009 version.
</P>
<P>Thanks to Ting Li (KULeuven) for flagging this issue.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>3 Jun 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Another upgrade to the <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump</A> tool to allow it to read
self-describing LAMMPS (or other) dump files that have the names of
the per-atom columns embedded in the file.  This one insures
that all versions of coordinates (x,xs,xu) are recognized by
the dump tool, so you don't have to use the dump.map() method.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.3Jun09">list of changed files</A> from the 16
Mar 2009 version.
</P>
<P>Thanks to Carolyn Phillips (U Mich) for pointing this out.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>16 Mar 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Upgraded the <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump</A> tool to allow it to read
self-describing LAMMPS (or other) dump files that have the names of
the per-atom columns embedded in the file.  If reading this
format of file, it means you don't have to label the columns
yourself with the dump.map() method.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.16Mar09">list of changed files</A> from the 1
Dec 2008 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>1 Dec 2008</B>
</P>
<P>Added a reorder command to the <A HREF = "doc/data.html">data</A> tool to allow data
files for different LAMMPS atom styles to more easily be created.
</P>
<P>Also added some options to the <A HREF = "doc/patch.html">patch</A> tool to allow it
to create 2d systems, and 2d stars and boxes and dimers as output
composite particles.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.1Dec08">list of changed files</A> from the 17
Nov 2007 version.

Nov 2007 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>15 Nov 2007</B>
</P>
<P>Added support to the <A HREF = "doc/data.html">data</A> tool for non-orthogonal
triclinic boxes in LAMMPS via the "xy xz yz" keyword that can appear
in the header portion of the data file.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.15Nov07">list of changed files</A> from the 10
Aug 2007 version.
</P>
<P>Thanks to Krishna Iyengar (Cornell U) for identifying the problem.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>10 Aug 2007</B>
</P>
<P>Added some sync logic to the <A HREF = "doc/gl.html">gl</A> and <A HREF = "doc/vcr.html">vcr</A>
tools to insure GL screenshots are captured correctly to files.  Was
having trouble with this on a faster graphics box.
</P>
<P>Also updated the Pizza.py install directions substantially,
to give details of how to install all the various Python
packages used by all the Pizza.py tools on a Linux box.
</P>
<P>In particular, the latest 3.0 version of PyOpenGL and the Tkinter
graphics lib seem much easier to install, so if that was a problem for
you before, try out the new instructions.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.10Aug07">list of changed files</A> from the 17
Jun 2007 version.
</P>
<HR>

May 2007 version.
</P>
<P>Thanks to Vladimir Stegailov for identifying the problem.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>3 May 2007</B>
</P>
<P>Added class 2 fields to the <A HREF = "doc/data.html">data</A> tool so it
can deal with LAMMPS data files that contain class 2 potential info.
</P>
<P>Also added an option to the <A HREF = "doc/plotview.html">plotview</A> tool
to set which vector is treated as the x-axis.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.3May07">list of changed files</A> from the 14
Apr 2007 version.
</P>
<P>Thanks to James Palko for pointing out the data tool deficiency.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>14 Apr 2007</B>
</P>
<P>Added a <A HREF = "doc/mdump.html">mdump</A> tool to read in mesh files and allow
them to be converted to Ensight format or visualized directly with
other Pizza.py tools such as the <A HREF = "doc/gl.html">gl</A> and
<A HREF = "doc/raster.html">raster</A> tools.
</P>
<P>The mesh file format is described on the <A HREF = "doc/mdump.html">mdump</A> doc
page.  2d triangular and 3d tetrahedral meshes are currently
supported.  Meshes can be static or dynamic and have nodal and/or
element quantities defined.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.14Apr07">list of changed files</A> from the 13
Apr 2007 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>13 Apr 2007</B>
</P>
<P>Added a sort option to the <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump</A> tool to allow
sorting of atom snapshots by any column (e.g. x or type) rather
than the default which is by atom ID.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.13Apr07">list of changed files</A> from the 12
Apr 2007 version.
</P>
