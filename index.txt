Pizza.py is a loosely integrated collection of tools, many of which
provide pre- and post-processing capability for the
"LAMMPS"_http://lammps.sandia.gov molecular dynamics,
"ChemCell"_http://chemcell.sandia.gov cell modeling, and
"SPPARKS"_http://spparks.sandia.gov kinetic Monte Carlo packages.
There are tools to create input files, convert between file formats,
process log and dump files, create plots, and visualize and animate
simulation snapshots.  Software packages that are wrapped by Pizza.py,
so they can be invoked from Python, include "GnuPlot"_gnuplot,
"MatLab"_matlab, "Raster3d"_raster3d, "RasMol"_rasmol, and "VMD"_vmd.

The name Pizza.py is meant to evoke the aroma of a collection of
"toppings" that the user can combine in different ways on a "crust" of
basic functionality, with Python as the "cheese" that glues everything
together.

Pizza.py is distributed as an "open source
code"_open_source.html under the terms of the "GPL"_gpl license
and can be "downloaded"_download.html from this site.

Pizza.py runs on any machine with "Python"_python installed.  Pizza.py
enhances the standard Python interpreter in a few simple ways.  It's
tools are Python modules which can be invoked interactively, from
scripts, or from GUIs when appropriate.  Some of the tools require
additional Python packages to be installed as part of your Python.
Others are wrappers on software packages (e.g. GnuPlot) which must be
available on your system.  If you don't have these add-ons or don't
want to use a particular tool, you don't have to load it when Pizza.py
starts up.  It's easy to modify or extend Pizza.py with new
functionality or new tools, which need not have anything to do with
"LAMMPS"_http://lammps.sandia.gov or
"ChemCell"_http://chemcell.sandia.gov.

The chief author of Pizza.py is "Steve Plimpton"_sjp who can be
contacted at sjplimp at sandia.gov.  Pizza.py is distributed by
"Sandia National Laboratories"_snl, a US Department of Energy
("DOE"_doe) laboratory.  Many of the tools were written by Matt Jones,
a BYU student who spent a summer at Sandia.  Funding for Pizza.py
development has come from the DOE and is "acknowledged
here"_thanks.html.

Recent Pizza.py News :c,h4

<IMG SRC = "images/new.gif"> (6/14) New "sdata tool"_doc/sdata.html
for reading, creating, writing surface files for the "SPARTA"_sparta
Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) code. :ulb,l

<IMG SRC = "images/new.gif"> (11/10) New "vmd tool"_doc/vmd.html
that is a wrapper on the popular "VMD visualization package", so that
it can be driven by Python and display
"LAMMPS"_http://lammps.sandia.gov snapshots in real time. :l

<IMG SRC = "images/new.gif"> (4/07) New "mdump
tool"_doc/mdump.html that reads in mesh files and their
associated nodal or element values for viz by other Pizza.py tools or
for output to Ensight format. :l

<IMG SRC = "images/new.gif"> (4/07) New "cfg tool"_doc/cfg.html
that converts LAMMPS data/dump files to the CFG format used by the
"AtomEye"_http://164.107.79.177/Archive/Graphics/A visualization
package.  Thanks to Aidan Thompson (Sandia). :l

<IMG SRC = "images/new.gif"> (10/06) New "ensight
tool"_doc/ensight.html that converts LAMMPS data/dump files to
the format used by the "Ensight"_http://www.ensight.com

Pizza.py and browsing past questions/answers in the
"archive"_http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=46693.
The new SourceForge "project page for
Pizza.py"_http://sourceforge.net/projects/pizza-py also allows for
"downloads"_http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=149496
of the Pizza.py package.  Here are "instructions"_mail.html on
various ways the Pizza.py mailing list can be used. :l,ule
