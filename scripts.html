<H3>Pizza.py Scripts 
</H3>
<P>The Pizza.py distribution includes a collection of scripts written by
Pizza.py users.  Those in the scripts directory are generically
useful; you may wish to use them directly or modify them for your own
purposes.  Those in the examples directory either illustrate how to
use a particular tool or were written to perform a specfic task.
</P>
<P>Here is the list of scripts from the scripts directory.  Clicking on
the script name will display the text of the script.

<P>Running any of these scripts is as simple as typing a line appropriate
to the script's syntax, e.g.
</P>
<PRE>% pizza.py -f movie.py svg 60 135 dump.*       from the shell
> @run movie.py svg 60 135 dump.*              from Pizza.py 
</PRE>
<P>The top of each script file describes its purpose and syntax.  That
information can be be accessed from within Pizza.py by typing "??" or
"? name.py" or "?? name.py".
