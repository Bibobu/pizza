Contributing to Pizza.py :h3

In the spirit of an open-source code, these are various ways you can
contribute to making Pizza.py better.  You can send email to sjplimp
at sandia.gov on any of these items.

If you write a Pizza.py script that is generally useful or illustrates
how to do something cool with Pizza.py, it can be added to the
Pizza.py script directory.  Ditto for a cool picture or movie that can
be added to the "Pizza.py WWW site"_pws. :ulb,l

If you add a new method to one of the tools or create a new tool that
is useful for Pizza.py or LAMMPS users, it can be added to the
Pizza.py distribution.  See the ToDo list at the top of each src/*.py
file for features we haven't yet implemented. :l

If you find a bug, report it. :l

Send an email if you find an error or omission in the "Pizza.py
documentation"_pd, or have a suggestion for something to clarify or
include. :l

Point prospective users to the "Pizza.py WWW Site"_pws or link to it
from your WWW site. :l

Cash.  Small denominations, unmarked bills preferred.  Leave in paper
sack on desk.  "VISA"_email also accepted.  Chocolate chip cookies
encouraged. :ule,l
