<P>Pizza.py is a loosely integrated collection of tools, many of which
provide pre- and post-processing capability for the
<A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS</A> molecular dynamics,
<A HREF = "http://chemcell.sandia.gov">ChemCell</A> cell modeling, and
<A HREF = "http://spparks.sandia.gov">SPPARKS</A> kinetic Monte Carlo packages.
There are tools to create input files, convert between file formats,
process log and dump files, create plots, and visualize and animate
simulation snapshots.  Software packages that are wrapped by Pizza.py,
so they can be invoked from Python, include <A HREF = "http://www.gnuplot.info">GnuPlot</A>,
<A HREF = "http://www.mathworks.com">MatLab</A>, <A HREF = "http://www.bmsc.washington.edu/raster3d/raster3d.html">Raster3d</A>, <A HREF = "http://openrasmol.org">RasMol</A>, and <A HREF = "http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd">VMD</A>.
</P>










<P>The name Pizza.py is meant to evoke the aroma of a collection of
"toppings" that the user can combine in different ways on a "crust" of
basic functionality, with Python as the "cheese" that glues everything
together.
</P>
<P>Pizza.py is distributed as an <A HREF = "open_source.html">open source
code</A> under the terms of the <A HREF = "http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</A> license
and can be <A HREF = "download.html">downloaded</A> from this site.
</P>
<P>Pizza.py runs on any machine with <A HREF = "http://www.python.org">Python</A> installed.  Pizza.py
enhances the standard Python interpreter in a few simple ways.  It's
tools are Python modules which can be invoked interactively, from
scripts, or from GUIs when appropriate.  Some of the tools require
additional Python packages to be installed as part of your Python.
Others are wrappers on software packages (e.g. GnuPlot) which must be
available on your system.  If you don't have these add-ons or don't
want to use a particular tool, you don't have to load it when Pizza.py
starts up.  It's easy to modify or extend Pizza.py with new
functionality or new tools, which need not have anything to do with
<A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS</A> or
<A HREF = "http://chemcell.sandia.gov">ChemCell</A>.
</P>
<P>The chief author of Pizza.py is <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp">Steve Plimpton</A> who can be
contacted at sjplimp at sandia.gov.  Pizza.py is distributed by
<A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov">Sandia National Laboratories</A>, a US Department of Energy
(<A HREF = "http://www.doe.gov">DOE</A>) laboratory.  Many of the tools were written by Matt Jones,
a BYU student who spent a summer at Sandia.  Funding for Pizza.py
development has come from the DOE and is <A HREF = "thanks.html">acknowledged
here</A>.

<P>The Pizza.py WWW site is hosted by Sandia, which has this <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/general/privacy-security/index.html">Privacy and
Security statement</A>.
